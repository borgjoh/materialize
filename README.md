[Materialize](http://materializecss.com/), a CSS Framework based on material design

### Current Version : v0.97.8 (rtl)

This framework is based on the original Materialize CSS framework v0.97.8 as developed by [Dogfalo](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize). The repository was forked out and a new branch was added [rtl_support](https://github.com/borgjoh/materialize/tree/rtl_support).

The framework creates two CSS files - one for LTR and one for RTL. Logic to load these files should be handled at application level. 

Original structure is in [master branch](https://github.com/borgjoh/materialize/tree/master)

## Sass Requirements:
- Ruby Sass 3.3+, LibSass 0.6+
